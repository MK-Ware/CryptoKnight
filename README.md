3. Supports 128, 192, and 256 bit key sizes (512 for Shacal2, and 512 and 1024 for Threefish)
4. Control over block size where possible
5. Option to securely wipe plain file after encryption
6. Supports the following hashing algorithms:
(MD2 - MD5 - SHA1 - SHA224 - SHA256 - SHA384 - SHA512 - bcrypt - scrypt)
7. Password booster generates strong yet reproducible passwords (check the source code or help => FAQ for algorithm details)
8. Random password generator with full control over password characters
9. Secure implementation & cryptographic salts
10. User friendly GUI.
11. 100% free

#Planned features:
1. Public key cryptography (RSA, DSA, Elgamal).
2. Steganography (F5 algorithm)
